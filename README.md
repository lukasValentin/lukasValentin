- 👋 Hi, I’m @lukasValentin (Lukas Valentin Graf) - PhD candidate in Agronomy at the Department of Environmental System Sciences at ETH Zurich 
- 🌱 My work is about crops and how to monitor them from space using optical satellite data (mainly Sentinel-2)
- ❤️ I love Python and Linux and apply them for all kind of geo-spatial analysis
- 🛰️ To work with 🌍 observation data I created the open-source [Earth Observation Data Analysis Library (EOdal)](https://github.com/EOA-team/eodal) together with [Gregor Perich](https://github.com/gperich)
- 🚲 In my spare time I enjoy cycling in the beautiful Swiss landscape, ⛰️ hiking and other outdoor activities such as ⛵ or 🧗‍♂️. I also like reading 📖 and writing ✍️
